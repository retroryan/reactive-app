== This Demo
This demo will stand up Spring application service that exposes a WebSocket service through the Spring 5's reactive https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#spring-webflux[WebSockets] API.
Typically, for inter-service comms, use a more traditional messaging system to deliver and expect events between services for example - messaging brokers such as https://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka], https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMq], etc.. 
WebSockets is an https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455[IETF] standard and https://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/[W3C] API that provides a convenient way to issue and consume data streams across the Internet. WebSockets is mainly used at edge consumption where data is being requested outside of your Service boundaries.

#A sample graph of services and then of a mix of clients that connect

== WebSocket Server
Spring's WebSocket API is new in Spring 5, and enables service construction in a Functional Reactive Programing method.
We will introduce a single WebSocket handler, and show whats needed to get started using Spring's reactive https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/socket/server/WebSocketService.html[`WebSocketService`] support.

To get started, wire in a https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.0.0.M1_to_4.2.0.M2/Spring%20Framework%204.0.0.M1/org/springframework/web/socket/adapter/WebSocketHandlerAdapter.html[`WebSocketHandlerAdapter`] to handle our web socket handshake, upgrade, and other connection details.

.socket_handler_adapter
[source,java]
----
    @Bean
    WebSocketHandlerAdapter socketHandlerAdapter() {
        return new WebSocketHandlerAdapter();
    }
----

===== Sending events down to a client
Next, fill in the WebSocket session handler. The simplest way to do this to use the functional interface for https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/socket/WebSocketHandler.html[`WebSocketHandler`] and implement it's `handle()` method to manage our stream response. In this, we will use the https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html#interval-java.time.Duration-[`Flux.interval`] operator and push it's output to the session for the client to consume.
Simply https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html#map-java.util.function.Function-[transform]/map the integer output as a String and send it to the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/socket/WebSocketSession.html#textMessage-java.lang.String-[`session.textMessage(String)`] or one of it's overrides depending on content for response.

.socket_session_handler
[source,java]
----
    WebSocketHandler webSocketHandler() {
        return session ->
                session.send(
                        Flux.interval(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
                                .map(n -> n.toString())
                                .map(session::textMessage)
                ).and(session.receive()
                        .map(WebSocketMessage::getPayloadAsText)
                        .doOnNext(msg -> log.info("Prime#: " + msg))
                        .doOnSubscribe(sub -> log.info("Started." + session.getId()))
                        .doFinally(sig -> log.info("Complete." + session.getId()))
                );
    }

==== Composing additional session-oriented operations
WebSocket Sessions are wraped within the reactive https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html[`Mono`] type that supports the the https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html#and-org.reactivestreams.Publisher-[`and()`] operator for chaining other publisher's termination signal.
We expect a client to respond with numbers it finds as prime. So, compose the extra step with the `session.receive()` publisher that emits, and logs client-origin messages to console.
Additionally, we'll make use of the `do...()` handlers to react to session events so we can do things like clean up resources after the connection is over.

==== WEB Friendly - URL Paths, CORS
Create an instance of https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/handler/SimpleUrlHandlerMapping.html[`SimpleUrlHandlerMapping`], and add Mappings for URL to WebSocketHandler exchanges.
Thus, a similar configuration option exists for CORS. To accomplish this, compose a simple default map for all URLs `*` given; this is a simplistic program.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[CORS] configurations are highly sensitive to the service implementor's nature, and come in specific variances that are outside the scope of this document.

.uri_handler_mapping
[source,java]
----
    @Bean
    HandlerMapping webSocketURLMapping() {
        SimpleUrlHandlerMapping simpleUrlHandlerMapping = new SimpleUrlHandlerMapping();
        simpleUrlHandlerMapping.setUrlMap(
                Collections.singletonMap("/ws/feed", webSocketHandler()));
        simpleUrlHandlerMapping.setCorsConfigurations(
                Collections.singletonMap("*", new CorsConfiguration().applyPermitDefaultValues()));
        return simpleUrlHandlerMapping;
    }
----

Finally, we will execute this server app:

.server_app_main
[source,java]
----
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(WebSocketConfiguration.class, args);
    }
----

Start the application:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run
...
INFO 10671 --- [           main] o.s.b.web.embedded.netty.NettyWebServer  : Netty started on port(s): 8080
----

Now we are ready to implement the https://github.com/marios-code-path/spring-web-sockets/tree/master/websocket-client[client], and talk to this service.
